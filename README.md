## Overview of the Project
Simply Books is a web application designed to mimic a book buying/selling platform where users can either be buyers or sellers, depending on the account they log into.

## Features

### **User Authentication**
- Login via Google to access your account and manage your books that you've bought or publish depending on whether you're a publisher.
  
**Note**: Currently, there is no way to become a publisher/manager without being directly added. (Request this from me: **Damitry111@gmail.com**)

### **Ownership**
- All created book cards are attached to your user profile, ensuring ownership over any books youâ€™ve published or bought.

### **Book Management**
- Books will be marked as **Published**, **Unpublished**, or **Bought** depending on conditions.
- If you're the publisher, you can **update** any books you publish, including modifying the details or marking them as published/unpublished.
- Buyers cannot modify their copy of the book aside from viewing it.

### **Checkout and Book Store**
- The application features a **checkout** system and a **book store**. You can browse the store and add books to your library, depending on your status as a buyer.

### **Profile Page**
- A **profile page** that displays your Google account information and a quick overview of your books, providing a personal dashboard of your bookshelves.

### **Intended users**
- Anyone who wants to be on it!!!
